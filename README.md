# Python
A repository that consits of code that I have written on my journey of learning python.  
Feel free to sumbit issues if you have any suggestions, or submit a pull request.  
A lot of this code won't be of much use, it will just be simple "Look what I learened".  
As I learn I plan on expaning my portfolio, if you have any suggestions on sites to learn from drop me a line.
